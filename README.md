# DGDelta
Directional Gradient Delta Optimization

run_experiments.py: modify main() with the desired params, then run cmdline python run_experiments.py. NOTE: right now you have change build_network.py by hand to change base optimizers (i.e. Adam, SGD, or Momentum) - you can uncomment the one you want, and comment out the rest.

view_results.ipynb: will show you examples of how to pull data and plot it. There are tons of different ways to slice the data, and I've only scratched the surface of what to look at.
